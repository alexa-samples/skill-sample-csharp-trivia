## Setting Up A Lambda Function Using Amazon Web Services
In the [first step of this guide](1-voice-user-interface.md), we built the Voice User Interface (VUI) for our Alexa skill. You can [read more about what a Lambda function is](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda), but for the purposes of this guide, what you need to know is that Lambda is where our code lives.  When a user asks Alexa to use our skill, it is our Lambda function that interprets the appropriate interaction, and provides the conversation back to the user.

1. Review and **implement the [C# Setup Instructions for AWS Lambda](../step-by-step-csharp/csharp-setup-for-AWS-Lambda.md)** to setup the Lambda via Visual Studio.

2. Go to http://aws.amazon.com and sign in to the console.

3.  Next we must create a **Trigger** to enable the C# Lambda Function previously uploaded to be triggered from an Alexa Skill. Select the **Alexa Skills Kit** option in the left _Add Triggers_ panel. An **Alexa Skills Kit** trigger is added with a _Configuration Required_ information alert.

4. Copy the Skill ID of the _Sample Trivia Skill - C#_ from the Amazon Developer Console. The ID is at the top of the Skill Information page and has the format of amzn1.ask.skill.XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX. Copy this value into required the Skill ID input box in the _Configure triggers_ section of the _sampleTriviaCsharp_ Lambda function page.

5. The final step, is to copy the Skill ID ARN (Amazon Resource Name) value from the top right corner of the _sampleTriviaCsharp_ Lambda function page. It has the format ```arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:############:function:sampleTriviaCsharp```. You will need this value in the next section of this guide.
